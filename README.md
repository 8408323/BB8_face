# BB8_face
This is a master thesis project carried out by Jonathan and Julia. The files in this repository will handle the expression of the face of the BB8-robot constructed.

This code was possible because of [Frojdholm][1].

All audio files are from [Audio][2]. I have only used the audio related to the BB8 droid.
